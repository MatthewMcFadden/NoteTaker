# Note Taker
Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js and will save and retrieve note data. Users are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When a user clicks on the link to the notes page they are presented with a page with existing saved notes and they are able to add notes as well.
