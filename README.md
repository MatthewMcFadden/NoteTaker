# Note Taker
Note Taker is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses Express.js and will save and retrieve note data. Users are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When a user clicks on the link to the notes page they are presented with a page with saved notes on the left that they can click on to read and edit existing notes. Users can also add new notes with the save icon at the top right of the page and they can delete an existing note by clicking on the red trash icon.
